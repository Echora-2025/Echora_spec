# Feature Specification: Real-Time Chat Platform

**Feature Branch**: `006-chat-platform`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "/chat endpoints: POST /chat/session (create real-time session), GET /chat/session/{id} (fetch session details), POST /chat/message (send text or voice message), GET /chat/history/{id} (load message history), GET /chat/ws (return WebSocket address + token)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Start a Real-Time Session (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to create a real-time chat session so that I can begin a conversation with another person or agent immediately.

**Why this priority**: Session creation is the entry point to all chat interactions; without it no other chat feature functions.

**Independent Test**: A tester can call `POST /chat/session`, receive a new session ID with metadata, and verify permissions without needing messaging or history endpoints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the requester provides participant information and context, **When** the session endpoint is invoked, **Then** the system creates a session record, assigns unique identifiers, and returns connection details (including supported capabilities).
2. **Given** the requester lacks permission to chat with a participant, **When** the request is processed, **Then** the system rejects it with a policy-compliant error and no session is created.
3. **Given** an identical session is requested shortly after creation, **When** idempotency headers or tokens are supplied, **Then** the system returns the existing session instead of creating duplicates.

### User Story 2 - Inspect Session Details (Priority: P1)

As a participant or moderator, I want to fetch chat session details so that I understand the participants, status, and configuration before joining or managing it.

**Why this priority**: Visibility into session state informs clients how to connect and control UI behavior.

**Independent Test**: A tester can call `GET /chat/session/{id}` and verify the response includes session metadata, participant list, and current status without depending on message flows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid session ID and authorization, **When** the endpoint is queried, **Then** the system returns session metadata (participants, start time, status, active channels, policies).
2. **Given** the session is closed or expired, **When** details are requested, **Then** the response makes the status explicit and signals whether reconnection is possible.
3. **Given** the requester is not part of the session and lacks moderation rights, **When** they request details, **Then** the system returns an access denied error without revealing participant identities.

---

### User Story 3 - Exchange Messages (Priority: P1)

As a participant, I want to send text or voice messages so that my conversation can continue in real time.

**Why this priority**: Messaging is the core activity inside the session; it must work across modalities (text/audio) reliably.

**Independent Test**: A tester can call `POST /chat/message` with text and also with audio payload references, verify validation, and confirm delivery receipts while sessions exist even if history fetching is offline.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a participant submits a valid text message, **When** the request is processed, **Then** the system persists the message, updates delivery state, and emits events to connected clients.
2. **Given** a participant uploads a voice message (file or stream reference), **When** it passes validation, **Then** the system stores the media reference, optionally generates transcripts, and notifies listeners with appropriate metadata.
3. **Given** the message violates content or rate policies, **When** the system detects it, **Then** the message is rejected, a clear policy error is returned, and moderation hooks are triggered.

### User Story 4 - Review Conversation History (Priority: P2)

As a participant, I want to load historical messages from a session so that I can recall earlier context or catch up on missed parts.

**Why this priority**: History access supports continuity but depends on sessions and messaging being available.

**Independent Test**: A tester can call `GET /chat/history/{id}` with pagination parameters and verify ordered messages, media references, and read states independent from WebSocket availability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid session with stored messages, **When** history is requested, **Then** the system returns paginated messages (newest or oldest order), includes timestamps and sender data, and respects deletion or redaction policies.
2. **Given** a requester lacks permission (e.g., removed participant), **When** they attempt to fetch history, **Then** the system denies access and includes remediation steps.

### User Story 5 - Establish Real-Time Connectivity (Priority: P2)

As a client application, I want to retrieve WebSocket connection information so that I can subscribe to live chat events efficiently.

**Why this priority**: WebSockets provide low-latency updates but are secondary to the REST endpoints they complement.

**Independent Test**: A tester can call `GET /chat/ws`, receive a time-bound `wss://` URL and access token, and confirm the token allows connection until expiry without sending messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the requester has an active session, **When** they request WebSocket credentials, **Then** the system returns a signed URL/token pair with expiry and scopes tied to the session.
2. **Given** the session is invalid or the requester lacks permissions, **When** the endpoint is called, **Then** it returns an authorization error and no connection details.

### Edge Cases

- Sessions created for large group chats must honor participant limits and provide clear errors when capacity is exceeded.
- Voice message uploads that fail mid-transfer should not leave incomplete records; the system must handle partial data cleanup and retries.
- Rapid message bursts require rate limiting and queueing to maintain ordering guarantees without data loss.
- Access revocation during an active session must immediately invalidate WebSocket tokens and prevent further message sends.
- History retrieval after redactions or deletions should respect legal and privacy policies while maintaining chronological integrity.
- WebSocket token leakage risk necessitates short-lived credentials and the ability to revoke them quickly.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide `POST /chat/session` that creates chat sessions with participant roster, capabilities, and status metadata, enforcing authorization and optional idempotency tokens.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide `GET /chat/session/{id}` returning session state details, including participants, status, policies, and timestamps, while enforcing access control.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide `POST /chat/message` accepting text payloads and voice message references, validating content, storing messages, and emitting delivery events.
- **FR-004**: System MUST support acknowledgements for message delivery, including message IDs, sender, and confirmed recipients for reliability tracking.
- **FR-005**: System MUST integrate content moderation and rate enforcement for messages, returning standardized policy errors when triggers are met.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide `GET /chat/history/{id}` delivering paginated message history with metadata (timestamps, senders, message types) and respecting redactions or deletions.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide `GET /chat/ws` returning a WebSocket endpoint URL and access token scoped to specific sessions and expiring within a defined time window.
- **FR-008**: System MUST revoke or refresh WebSocket tokens when sessions end or permissions change, preventing unauthorized real-time access.
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure message ordering guarantees (per session) across REST and WebSocket delivery paths.
- **FR-010**: System MUST log session creation, message events, history access, and WebSocket token issuance for auditing and analytics.
- **FR-011**: System MUST standardize error payloads (codes, user messages, remediation hints) across chat endpoints.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **ChatSession**: Stores session ID, participants, status, capabilities, start/end timestamps, and policy flags.
- **ChatParticipant**: Represents a user or agent in a session, including permissions, role, and connection state.
- **ChatMessage**: Contains message ID, session ID, sender, content type (text, voice), payload references, timestamps, delivery status, and moderation tags.
- **MessageReceipt**: Records delivery acknowledgements, read states, and recipient metadata.
- **WebSocketCredential**: Holds issued `wss://` URL, token, expiry, scopes, and revocation state.
- **ChatAuditLog**: Captures creation, message, history access, and token issuance events with outcomes for compliance.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 99% of `POST /chat/session` requests complete with a valid session response in under 800 ms during nominal load.
- **SC-002**: 99% of `POST /chat/message` requests persist and emit delivery events within 1 second for text and 2 seconds for voice messages.
- **SC-003**: 95% of `GET /chat/history/{id}` requests deliver the first page of messages in under 1 second for sessions with â‰¤500 messages.
- **SC-004**: WebSocket token issuance via `GET /chat/ws` succeeds within 500 ms for 99.5% of authorized requests and tokens expire within 2 minutes of session termination.
- **SC-005**: Audit log coverage for chat operations remains at 100% with no missing entries over a 30-day monitoring window.

### Assumptions

- Authentication, authorization, and identity resolution infrastructure already exist to validate requesters and their session permissions.
- Storage and messaging backends (including media storage for voice messages) are available to handle persistence and streaming outside this feature scope.
- Content moderation tooling can be called synchronously or asynchronously to evaluate messages before delivery when required.
- WebSocket infrastructure supports token-based authentication and can handle revocation events in near real time.

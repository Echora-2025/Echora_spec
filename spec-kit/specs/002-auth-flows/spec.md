# Feature Specification: Authentication Endpoints

**Feature Branch**: `002-auth-flows`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "/auth/register, /auth/login, /auth/logout"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Account Registration (Priority: P1)

As a new visitor, I want to create an account using my email and password so that I can access protected areas of the application.

**Why this priority**: Registration is the entry point for new users; without it the product cannot grow its user base.

**Independent Test**: A tester can submit a valid registration payload and verify the system returns confirmation, creates the user record, and sends a verification notice without relying on other stories.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user provides unique credentials that meet password rules, **When** they submit the registration request, **Then** the system creates the account, records consent metadata, and returns a success response containing next steps (e.g., email verification).
2. **Given** a user submits credentials that violate validation rules, **When** the registration is attempted, **Then** the system rejects the request with field-specific errors and does not create a partial account.
3. **Given** a user attempts to register with an email already in use, **When** the request is processed, **Then** the system returns a duplication error and guidance to log in or recover access.

### User Story 2 - Secure Login (Priority: P1)

As a returning user, I want to authenticate with my email and password so that I can regain access to my personalized experience.

**Why this priority**: Logging in is essential for active users to reach their content; availability and security of this flow directly affect retention.

**Independent Test**: A tester can provide valid credentials, receive an authentication token, and confirm protected resources become accessible without relying on registration or logout flows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user supplies valid credentials, **When** they call the login endpoint, **Then** the system validates the account state, issues an authenticated session token, and returns user profile basics needed by the client.
2. **Given** a user has not completed required verifications, **When** they attempt to log in, **Then** the system denies access, references the outstanding requirement, and does not create a session.
3. **Given** a user submits incorrect credentials multiple times, **When** the attempts exceed the limit, **Then** the system throttles or temporarily locks the account and communicates the cooldown policy.

### User Story 3 - Session Termination (Priority: P2)

As an authenticated user, I want to log out from the application so that I can end access on the current device and protect my account.

**Why this priority**: Explicit logout supports shared-device scenarios and regulatory requirements for session management, safeguarding user privacy.

**Independent Test**: A tester can call the logout endpoint with a valid token and confirm the session is invalidated, preventing further access without logging back in.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is authenticated, **When** they invoke the logout endpoint, **Then** the system invalidates the active session token(s) for that device and confirms completion.
2. **Given** a logout request references an already-expired token, **When** the system processes it, **Then** it responds idempotently (success with no side effects) and provides guidance if re-authentication is required.

### Edge Cases

- Registration payloads with optional profile data missing or null should succeed while applying sensible defaults.
- Password creation or login attempts that trigger rate limits or suspicious-activity thresholds require consistent messaging and audit logging.
- Account states such as soft-deleted, suspended, or unverified must enforce the appropriate access restrictions even if credentials are correct.
- Concurrent logout requests from multiple devices must gracefully handle already-terminated sessions without surfacing server errors.
- API consumers that omit required headers (e.g., content type, authorization) should receive standardized error responses that do not leak sensitive details.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a `/auth/register` endpoint that accepts email, password, and optional profile fields, validates inputs, and creates a user record with pending verification status.
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce password complexity and email ownership verification policies during registration responses.
- **FR-003**: System MUST send a confirmation mechanism (e.g., email) after successful registration and record the delivery attempt for compliance tracking.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a `/auth/login` endpoint that validates credentials, checks account state (verified, active, not locked), and issues a session artifact (token or cookie) with expiration metadata.
- **FR-005**: System MUST log authentication attempts, including source metadata and outcome, to support monitoring and fraud detection.
- **FR-006**: System MUST return standardized error payloads for failed registration or login attempts, differentiating between validation issues, unverified accounts, locked accounts, and generic failures without exposing credential hints.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a `/auth/logout` endpoint that invalidates the callerâ€™s active session(s) and ensures subsequent requests using the same artifact are rejected.
- **FR-008**: System MUST support session management for multiple devices, allowing targeted logout of the current session without impacting other valid sessions unless configured otherwise.
- **FR-009**: System MUST expose rate-limiting feedback headers or metadata so clients can adapt when authentication thresholds are reached.
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain audit trails for account creation, login successes, login failures, and logout events in accordance with retention policies.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **UserAccount**: Stores identity attributes, credential metadata (hashed), verification status, lock state, and timestamps for key security events.
- **SessionArtifact**: Represents issued authentication tokens or session identifiers; tracks device context, expiration, revocation state, and last activity.
- **VerificationRecord**: Captures outgoing confirmation actions (email or other), delivery status, and completion timestamps tied to UserAccount.
- **AuthAttemptLog**: Records each registration, login, or logout attempt with result codes and risk signals for monitoring and compliance.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 99% of valid registration requests complete in under 2 seconds (excluding external verification latency) during load tests at target user volume.
- **SC-002**: 99.5% of successful login attempts issue a usable session artifact within 1 second of credential validation under nominal load.
- **SC-003**: Fewer than 0.5% of registration attempts fail due to duplicate submissions after the first success, indicating idempotency is effective.
- **SC-004**: Session revocation latency is under 5 seconds for 95% of logout requests before the revoked token is rejected by protected resources.
- **SC-005**: Security monitoring reports fewer than 0.1% of authentication responses leaking implementation details or stack traces over a 30-day observation window.

### Assumptions

- The application already has infrastructure for delivering transactional emails or equivalent verification messages.
- Credential storage leverages a compliant secret management solution that handles hashing, salting, and rotation outside the scope of this feature.
- API consumers can securely store and transmit session artifacts (tokens or cookies) according to platform guidelines.
- Rate limiting, monitoring, and alerting tooling are available to integrate with authentication logs.

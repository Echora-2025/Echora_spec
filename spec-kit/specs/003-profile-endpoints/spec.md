# Feature Specification: Profile Service Enhancements

**Feature Branch**: `003-profile-endpoints`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "/profile: GET /profile/{id} 查看个人档案, PUT /profile/update 更新个人档案, GET /profile/values 获取用户的价值观雷达图数据, POST /profile/avatar 上传头像或语音签名"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Profile Details (Priority: P1)

As a user or authorized viewer, I want to retrieve someone’s profile by ID so that I can review their biography, achievements, and current status in a single view.

**Why this priority**: Read access underpins every subsequent interaction; without reliable retrieval the profile experience fails.

**Independent Test**: A tester can call `GET /profile/{id}` with valid permissions and confirm the response contains required fields, localized labels, and privacy-respecting redactions independent of other stories.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid profile ID and the requester has read permission, **When** the endpoint is invoked, **Then** the system returns a complete profile payload including headline fields, contact preferences, and media references.
2. **Given** the profile owner has hidden certain sections, **When** the viewer lacks access, **Then** the response omits or masks restricted attributes and indicates the visibility state.
3. **Given** the profile ID does not exist or access is denied, **When** the request is made, **Then** the system responds with a standardized error that explains whether the profile is missing or inaccessible without leaking sensitive information.

### User Story 2 - Update Profile Information (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user, I want to update my profile details so that my public information stays accurate and aligned with my current goals.

**Why this priority**: Profile freshness affects credibility and engagement; lacking self-service updates creates churn.

**Independent Test**: A tester can send a valid payload to `PUT /profile/update`, receive confirmation, and verify stored data changes, even if other endpoints are unavailable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user submits valid updates (e.g., bio, roles, location), **When** the request is processed, **Then** the system validates fields, applies changes, records audit metadata, and returns the refreshed profile snapshot.
2. **Given** the payload contains invalid or restricted fields (e.g., banned words, exceeded length), **When** the API handles it, **Then** it returns field-level errors, preserves prior data, and requests correction.
3. **Given** simultaneous updates occur from multiple devices, **When** a conflict would overwrite newer data, **Then** the system detects it and responds with conflict guidance (e.g., version mismatch) without partial saves.

### User Story 3 - View Values Radar Insights (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to see my values radar chart data so that I understand how my preferences map to the platform’s values model.

**Why this priority**: Values insights motivate continued engagement and guide personalized content, but rely on existing profile context.

**Independent Test**: A tester can call `GET /profile/values`, confirm the returned axes, scores, timestamps, and interpretation hints, even if other profile features are offline.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** radar data exists for the user, **When** they request it, **Then** the system returns normalized scores per dimension, last-updated time, and contextual labels for chart rendering.
2. **Given** radar data has not been generated, **When** the user calls the endpoint, **Then** the system returns a clear placeholder status and instructions on how to generate or unlock the insights.

### User Story 4 - Manage Avatar and Voice Signature (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to upload or replace my profile avatar or voice signature so that my presence feels personalized and recognizable across the experience.

**Why this priority**: Media cues enhance trust and accessibility, especially in voice-led interactions.

**Independent Test**: A tester can send a compliant media payload to `POST /profile/avatar`, observe validation, check storage references, and verify the new asset appears on subsequent profile fetches.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an upload meets file type, size, and safety checks, **When** the request succeeds, **Then** the system stores the asset, links it to the profile, and returns updated media metadata.
2. **Given** the upload fails validation (size limit, unsupported format, unsafe content), **When** the request is processed, **Then** the system rejects it with a descriptive error and preserves the previous asset.
3. **Given** the user replaces an existing avatar or voice signature, **When** the new asset is accepted, **Then** the system retires the old asset reference according to retention policy and propagates changes to cached profile views within defined latency.

### Edge Cases

- Requests for deactivated or deleted profiles should respond with consistent messaging and avoid revealing personal data.
- Bulk profile viewers (e.g., admins) may request multiple IDs rapidly; rate limiting and caching must prevent abuse while honoring SLAs.
- Update payloads that only partially change nested data must merge correctly without unintentionally clearing unspecified fields.
- Radar data calculations might lag behind profile updates; the system must surface the last refresh time and avoid mixing stale and fresh metrics.
- Media uploads interrupted mid-transfer must not leave orphaned assets; cleanup routines or resumable uploads should handle failures gracefully.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide `GET /profile/{id}` returning a structured profile document with core fields, visibility metadata, and localization-ready labels.
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce authorization and privacy rules on profile retrieval, ensuring restricted fields are masked or omitted based on viewer roles.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide `PUT /profile/update` that validates input, enforces field-level permissions, applies updates atomically, and returns the updated profile snapshot.
- **FR-004**: System MUST track profile update history with timestamps, change summaries, and actor identifiers for auditing.
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure concurrent profile updates detect version conflicts and respond with guidance to refresh data before resubmitting.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide `GET /profile/values` delivering radar dimensions, normalized scores, last refreshed timestamp, and any interpretation tips or thresholds.
- **FR-007**: System MUST communicate when values data is unavailable, including triggers for regeneration or prerequisites the user must complete.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide `POST /profile/avatar` accepting avatar images or voice signature clips, enforcing size/format/content rules, and returning updated media references.
- **FR-009**: System MUST propagate approved media changes to downstream caches or CDN references within 2 minutes and retire previous assets per retention policies.
- **FR-010**: System MUST produce standardized error payloads with codes, messages, and remediation hints across all profile endpoints.
- **FR-011**: System MUST log each profile read, update, values retrieval, and media upload event with outcome status for observability and compliance.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Profile**: Contains identity, biography, visibility settings, contact preferences, radar references, and media pointers for a user.
- **ProfileUpdateRequest**: Represents incoming change submissions with validation state, version identifiers, and audit metadata.
- **ValuesRadar**: Stores dimension definitions, score arrays, normalization factors, and refresh timestamps associated with a Profile.
- **ProfileMediaAsset**: Tracks avatar or voice signature metadata including storage location, checksum, moderation status, and active/inactive flags.
- **ProfileAccessLog**: Records endpoint accesses, actor identity, purpose (self, admin, public), and result codes.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 99% of profile retrieval requests complete in under 500 ms under nominal load for cached profiles and under 1.5 seconds for uncached profiles.
- **SC-002**: 98% of valid profile update submissions apply successfully on first attempt without requiring manual intervention.
- **SC-003**: Values radar data freshness meets a maximum staleness threshold of 24 hours for 95% of requests.
- **SC-004**: Media uploads that pass validation propagate the new asset to profile consumers within 120 seconds 95% of the time.
- **SC-005**: Audit logs for profile operations remain 100% complete (no missing entries) during a 30-day monitoring window.

### Assumptions

- The system already has authentication and role-based access control in place to identify the requester.
- Media storage, moderation, and CDN infrastructure exist and can be invoked via service calls outside the scope of these endpoints.
- Values radar scores are generated by an existing analytics service that can be queried synchronously or asynchronously when required.
- Localization frameworks and privacy policies define how profile fields map to viewer permissions.

# Feature Specification: Core Profile APIs

**Feature Branch**: `005-profile-core`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "/profile endpoints: GET /profile/{id} view profile, PUT /profile/update update profile, POST /profile/avatar upload avatar"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Profile Snapshot (Priority: P1)

As a user or authorized viewer, I want to fetch a personâ€™s profile by ID so that I can understand their background, availability, and current status in one place.

**Why this priority**: Read access is foundational to all other profile experiences; if users cannot retrieve a profile, no other profile feature matters.

**Independent Test**: A tester can seed profile data, call `GET /profile/{id}`, and verify the response includes required fields, honors visibility settings, and returns within performance targets.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid profile ID and sufficient permissions, **When** the endpoint is invoked, **Then** the system returns the profile payload with key sections (bio, roles, social links, media references) and associated metadata.
2. **Given** the requester lacks permission for certain sections, **When** the response is produced, **Then** restricted fields are masked or omitted and the response indicates their visibility state.
3. **Given** the profile does not exist or access is denied, **When** `GET /profile/{id}` is called, **Then** the system returns a standardized error without leaking sensitive data.

### User Story 2 - Update Profile Information (Priority: P1)

As an authenticated user, I want to update my profile details so that my public representation stays accurate and aligned with my goals.

**Why this priority**: Self-service editing keeps data fresh and reduces manual support; it is a critical daily action.

**Independent Test**: A tester can submit a valid payload to `PUT /profile/update`, receive success confirmation, and confirm the stored record reflects the changes without relying on other endpoints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user submits valid updates within allowed fields, **When** the request is processed, **Then** the system validates input, applies the changes atomically, records audit metadata, and returns the refreshed profile snapshot.
2. **Given** the payload violates validation rules or includes restricted fields, **When** the update is attempted, **Then** the system rejects it with field-level errors and preserves the prior record.
3. **Given** concurrent updates occur, **When** a conflict would overwrite newer data, **Then** the system detects the version mismatch and instructs the user to reload before resubmitting.

### User Story 3 - Manage Profile Avatar (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to upload or replace my profile avatar so that people recognize me across the platform.

**Why this priority**: Visual identity boosts trust and engagement but depends on the core profile existing first.

**Independent Test**: A tester can call `POST /profile/avatar` with a compliant file, validate that moderation and storage checks pass, and confirm the new avatar appears on subsequent profile fetches.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an upload meets format and size requirements, **When** the request succeeds, **Then** the system stores the asset, links it to the profile, and returns updated media metadata.
2. **Given** the upload fails validation (e.g., unsupported format, oversized file, unsafe content), **When** the request is processed, **Then** the system rejects it with actionable feedback and retains the existing avatar.
3. **Given** a user replaces an existing avatar, **When** the new asset is accepted, **Then** the system retires the prior asset reference per retention policy and propagates the change to cached profile responses within defined latency.

### Edge Cases

- Profiles belonging to deactivated or suspended users must return limited information with policy-compliant messaging.
- Update payloads that omit optional nested fields must not erase existing data unintentionally.
- Avatar uploads interrupted mid-transfer should not leave orphaned storage objects; resumable uploads or cleanup routines must address partial files.
- Clients operating on stale profile versions need clear conflict signals to avoid overwriting newer edits.
- Requesters attempting to view or update profiles without sufficient authentication must receive consistent authorization errors.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide `GET /profile/{id}` returning a structured profile document with core fields, visibility indicators, and localization-ready labels.
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce authorization and privacy on profile retrieval, masking or omitting restricted sections based on viewer roles and consents.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide `PUT /profile/update` that validates inputs, enforces field-level permissions, applies changes atomically, and returns the updated profile snapshot.
- **FR-004**: System MUST track profile update history, including actor, changed fields summary, and timestamps for auditing.
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect conflicting updates (e.g., via version identifiers) and respond with conflict guidance instead of overwriting newer data.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide `POST /profile/avatar` accepting avatar media, applying size/format/moderation rules, storing the asset, and returning updated media references.
- **FR-007**: System MUST propagate avatar changes to downstream caches/CDN endpoints within 2 minutes for 95% of updates and retire previous assets per retention policies.
- **FR-008**: System MUST standardize error responses for all profile endpoints, including codes, human-readable messages, and remediation hints.
- **FR-009**: System MUST log each profile retrieval, update, and avatar upload event with outcome status for observability and compliance.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Profile**: Stores identity attributes, biography, visibility settings, contact preferences, and media references for a user.
- **ProfileUpdateRequest**: Represents incoming change submissions with validation status, version identifiers, and audit metadata.
- **ProfileMediaAsset**: Tracks avatar file metadata, storage location, moderation status, and active/inactive flags.
- **ProfileAccessLog**: Captures profile endpoint activity, including actor identity, action type, result, and timestamp.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 99% of `GET /profile/{id}` responses complete within 750 ms for cached data and 1.5 seconds for uncached data under nominal load.
- **SC-002**: 98% of valid profile update requests commit successfully on first attempt, with conflict responses returned in under 1 second when triggered.
- **SC-003**: Avatar uploads that pass validation become visible in subsequent profile responses within 120 seconds 95% of the time.
- **SC-004**: Audit logging coverage for profile read, update, and avatar actions remains at 100% during a 30-day monitoring period.

### Assumptions

- Authentication and role-based access control are already implemented to identify the requester and permissions.
- Media storage, moderation, and CDN tooling exist and can be invoked from the avatar endpoint.
- Localization and privacy policies defining field visibility are documented and available to the service layer.
- Monitoring infrastructure is in place to collect and review profile access and update logs.

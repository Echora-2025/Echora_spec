# Feature Specification: Voice Agent Chat

**Feature Branch**: `001-voice-agent-chat`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that helps people chat with voice agent"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Real-time Voice Conversation (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to hold a natural-feeling, real-time voice conversation with the agent so that I can speak and hear responses without typing.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition; without reliable two-way voice communication the application fails to deliver its purpose.

**Independent Test**: A tester can start a new session, exchange a minimum of three turns with the agent using only speech, and confirm latency, intelligibility, and conversational continuity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user grants microphone access, **When** they press the talk control and speak, **Then** the system captures the audio, shows the recognized text, and confirms the agent is processing the request.
2. **Given** the agent generates a response, **When** the system delivers it, **Then** the user hears clear synthesized speech and sees the transcribed text aligned with the correct speaker.
3. **Given** the user or agent is speaking, **When** overlapping input is detected, **Then** the system pauses the inactive party and clearly signals the current speaker state.

### User Story 2 - Conversation Review & Continuity (Priority: P2)

As a returning user, I want to review past conversations and resume where I left off so that I can maintain context across sessions.

**Why this priority**: Transcript visibility and continuity build trust, enable corrections, and reduce repeated explanations, significantly improving retention.

**Independent Test**: A tester can complete a session, exit the app, reopen it, and verify they can browse transcripts, search within them, and restart a session that continues prior context within measurable limits.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a session has ended, **When** the user opens the history screen, **Then** the system lists past sessions with timestamps, duration, and summary snippets.
2. **Given** the user selects a previous session, **When** they tap resume, **Then** the system loads prior context, confirms the agent is ready, and begins a new turn that references the restored history.

### User Story 3 - Voice Agent Personalization (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to adjust the agent’s speaking style and interaction preferences so that the experience matches my accessibility and tone needs.

**Why this priority**: Personalization increases accessibility and user satisfaction, enabling broader adoption and reducing friction for diverse users.

**Independent Test**: A tester can change voice persona settings (e.g., tone, speaking rate), save them, and confirm the agent honors the selections immediately and across sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** personalization settings are available, **When** the user chooses a different speaking style, **Then** the next agent response reflects the updated style and the change persists for future sessions until altered again.
2. **Given** accessibility options are enabled, **When** the user toggles visual aids (e.g., large captions), **Then** the interface updates instantly without disrupting the conversation.

### Edge Cases

- Microphone permission is denied or revoked mid-conversation, requiring fallbacks and guidance to re-enable it.
- Background noise or silence longer than the timeout threshold occurs, and the system must prompt the user or auto-complete the turn.
- Network connectivity drops or degrades, and the system needs to queue, retry, or gracefully suspend the session.
- The agent response exceeds the maximum allowed duration or size, requiring truncation or summarization with user notification.
- Multiple users attempt to use the same account simultaneously, and the system must handle concurrent session conflicts.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to initiate a voice session with a single explicit action and confirm when the agent is listening.
- **FR-002**: System MUST capture user speech, perform real-time transcription, and display the recognized text before the agent responds.
- **FR-003**: System MUST relay each user utterance to the voice agent service and receive structured response data (speech plus text).
- **FR-004**: System MUST play agent responses audibly with adjustable volume and provide synchronized textual captions for accessibility.
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain a turn-by-turn transcript that timestamps each entry, labels the speaker, and highlights unresolved follow-ups.
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist completed conversation sessions, allow users to browse, search, and replay them, and support resuming within the last 24 hours of inactivity.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide configurable personalization controls (voice persona, speaking rate, verbosity level, caption display) that take effect immediately and persist across devices for authenticated users.
- **FR-008**: System MUST detect and surface microphone, agent, or connectivity errors in under 2 seconds with actionable recovery guidance.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to clear transcripts and revoke stored audio within their account, reflecting the changes across all synchronized devices within 1 minute.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **ConversationSession**: Represents a bounded interaction between user and agent; stores metadata (start/end timestamps, summary, status) and references associated ConversationTurns.
- **ConversationTurn**: Captures a single exchange from either party, including speaker role, audio reference, transcript text, confidence scores, and any follow-up flags.
- **VoiceProfile**: Holds user-selected personalization preferences such as voice persona, speaking rate, verbosity, and caption options; applies to new and resumed sessions.
- **UserAccount**: Stores identity, privacy settings, data retention preferences, and consent states that govern access to transcripts and personalization sync.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of successful session initiations provide audible confirmation of agent readiness within 1.5 seconds of the user pressing the talk control.
- **SC-002**: Transcription accuracy for common vocabulary maintains at least 92% word-level correctness during quiet-room benchmark tests.
- **SC-003**: 90% of post-session survey respondents report that reviewing transcripts helped them recall key information (score ≥ 4 on 5-point scale).
- **SC-004**: Fewer than 3% of sessions fail due to unhandled connectivity or agent errors, and all failures include user-facing recovery steps within 2 seconds.
- **SC-005**: At least 80% of users who adjust personalization settings keep the customized profile active across two or more sessions, indicating retained preference satisfaction.

### Assumptions

- Users have stable network connectivity and compatible devices capable of real-time audio capture and playback.
- A compliant voice agent backend is available to handle intent understanding, response generation, and text-to-speech output.
- Users consent to storing transcripts and audio snippets for personalization, with options presented during onboarding.
